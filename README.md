Quake-Life is a QuakeC conversion of the core Half-Life 1 entities into 
a playable Quake mod. All half-life monsters and weapons are replaced 
with Quake 1 entities, and various button and trinkets are tweaked to be 
more "Quake-like". The goal of this mod if to allow modders to have
maps that are multi-compatable for half-life 1 and quake, and also adds 
the ability for Quake 1 users to play through half-life levels.

**Current Status**

This is a copy of the original Quake Life open source release. The 
project has not reached error-free status as there are issues 
with entering some areas. It is a large undertaking to go through each 
map in Half Life and ensure all the areas are accessible and have monsters, 
weapons and other artifacts inserted at appropriate spots. The project 
is totally hackable and will remain open to anyone to make 
modifications.


**Installation:**

Place the progs.dat into a folder named "quakelife"

To play Half-Life 1 or Half-Life Uplink Demo:

* Extract the contents of the "valve" folder into the quakelife folder
* To play the Uplink demo, set the server's map to "hldemo1"
* To play the Half-Life single-player game, start on map "c1a0" (c0a0 
set 
not fully supported yet)
* To play the training levels, set the map to "t0a0"

HLAG is an attempt to reimplement Half-Life AdrenalineGamer
mod using FTEQW, so modifications done since the fork was 
made pursuited other aims than `quakelife`.
## Assets
All the `.md2` and `.png` assets which resides in progs/
folders are made by me (Rv4Flyver) as a rough replacement
for required ones. They can be used for free without any
restrictions, though any credits are appreciated :)
